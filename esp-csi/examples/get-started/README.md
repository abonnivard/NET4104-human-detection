# Get Started Examples
This example demonstrates how to obtain CSI data through communication between two espressif chips, and uses a graphical interface to display real-time data of CSI subcarriers

## hardware

You need to prepare two development boards for espressif chips, one as the sender and the other as the receiver

![example_display](./docs/_static/example_display.png)

In order to ensure the perception effect of CSI, please do your best to meet the following requirements
1. Use ESP32-C3 / ESP32-S3: ESP32-C3 / ESP32-S3 is the best RF chip at present
2. Use an external antenna: PCB antenna has poor directivity and is easily interfered by the motherboard
3. The distance between the two devices is more than one meter

##Binding


1. Burn the firmware of `csi_recv` and `csi_send` on two development boards respectively

    ![device_log](./docs/_static/device_log.png)

    ```shell
    # csi_send
    cd esp-csi/examples/get-started/csi_send
    idf.py set-target esp32c3
    idf.py flash -b 921600 -p /dev/ttyUSB0 monitor

    # csi_recv
    cd esp-csi/examples/get-started/csi_recv
    idf.py set-target esp32c3
    idf.py flash -b 921600 -p /dev/ttyUSB1
    ```

2. Run `csi_data_read_parse.py` in `csi_recv` for data analysis, Please close `idf.py monitor` before running

    ```shell
    cd esp-csi-gitlab/examples/get-started/tools

    # Install python related dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Graphical display
    python csi_data_read_parse.py -p /dev/ttyUSB1
    ```

## A&Q

### 1. `csi_send` prints no memory
- **Phenomenon**: The following log appears on the serial port:
  ```shell
    W (510693) csi_send: <ESP_ERR_ESPNOW_NO_MEM> ESP-NOW send error
  ````
- **Reason**: The current channel is congested causing congestion in sending packets, so that the ESP-NOW buffer space is full
- **Solution**: Change the Wi-Fi channel or change to a place with a better network environment

### 2. `csi_data_read_parse.py` Serial port printing exception
- **Phenomenon**: The following log appears on the serial port:
    ```shell
        element number is not equal
        data is not incomplete
    ````
- **Reason**: PYQT takes up a lot of CPU when drawing, causing the PC to be unable to read the serial port buffer queue in time, resulting in data confusion
- **Solution**: Advance the baud rate of the serial port
